Deep Neural Network from Scratch for CIFAR-10 Image Classification
Overview
This project demonstrates how to build a Deep Neural Network (DNN) from scratch and apply it to the CIFAR-10 image classification dataset. The goal of the project is to give a detailed understanding of neural network architecture, its components, and how they work together to solve an image classification task.

Key Features:
Custom-built DNN without using any deep learning libraries for model construction.
TensorFlow was used exclusively for loading and pre-processing the CIFAR-10 dataset.
Implemented techniques like backpropagation, weight updates, and performance evaluation from scratch.
Optimized the network to handle the challenging task of classifying images across 10 distinct categories.
Dataset
We used the CIFAR-10 dataset, which contains:

60,000 color images of 32x32 pixels in 10 different categories (e.g., airplanes, automobiles, birds, cats, dogs).
50,000 training images and 10,000 test images.
